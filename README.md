<h1>Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 🚀</h1>

<h2>📌 Overview</h2>

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. It is designed to help students and professionals strengthen their problem-solving skills.

<h2>📚 Topics Covered</h2>

<h3>1️⃣ Data Structures</h3>

Arrays

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Stacks

Queues

Hash Maps / Hash Tables

Heaps / Priority Queues

Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)

Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)

<h3>2️⃣ Algorithms</h3>

Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort, etc.)

Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, Ternary Search, etc.)

Recursion & Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, etc.)

Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, LCS, etc.)

Greedy Algorithms

Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd Warshall, etc.)

Divide & Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

<h2>📌 Roadmap</h2>

Start with Basics → Arrays, Strings, Recursion

📚 Topics Covered

1️⃣ Data Structures

Arrays

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Stacks

Queues

Hash Maps / Hash Tables

Heaps / Priority Queues

Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)

Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)

2️⃣ Algorithms

Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort, etc.)

Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, Ternary Search, etc.)

Recursion & Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, etc.)

Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, LCS, etc.)

Greedy Algorithms

Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd Warshall, etc.)

Divide & Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

📌 Roadmap
